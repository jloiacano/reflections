How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

FC or diff helps to narrow down the changes to just the lines that changed and leave everything else that stayed the same out.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Being able to see past mistakes and learn from them. Especially repeated mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	pros: the point of commit is an actual quantifiable change
	cons: you might forget, or commit too late after too much has been changed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git is made for programs that are likely to have multiple interconected files, whereas Google Docs is intended for standalone documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log: to find all the commits and their IDs in reverse chronological order
git diff: to take two of the commits by their id and compare them to each other by lines inserted and lines deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Incredibly so. On larger projects in android studio, having it saved 30-some-odd times takes up a lot of space! And branches for different possible changes?! Nice...

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

First, getting through the rest of the course... Following, my next Android Project will be using this.
